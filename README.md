# Root Business Service Provider
The Root Business Service Provider enables the [Resolver](https://github.com/OpenDiscoveryBiz/resolver) to look-up the national or regional business service provider, that is authoritative for a specific Business ID. Ultimately it should be hosted by one or more international organizations. It has a purpose similar to the root DNS servers that delegate look-up requests to the DNS servers authoritative for specific top level domains.

The Root Business Service Provider is one of several components needed to enable Distributed Business Service Discovery scenarios.

These components are currently under initial development and we welcome collaboration on the further development of scope and principles (Contact: [Henrik Biering](mailto:hb@peercraft.com)) as well as the technical implementation (Contact: [Casper Biering](mailto:cb@peercraft.com)).
